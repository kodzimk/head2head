**CRITICAL: ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE ABOUT {sport.upper()} ONLY - NO OTHER SPORTS**

STYLE: {style_variation}

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- EVERY question must be specifically about {sport.upper()}

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
- Make questions engaging and fun, not just factual
- Use different question formats (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
- Include questions that test reasoning, not just memory
- Mix serious and entertaining questions
- Ensure all questions are accurate and up-to-date
- Make answer choices plausible and challenging
- Avoid repetitive question patterns
- Use varied sentence structures and complexity
- Make some questions about lesser-known aspects and trivia

VARIETY REQUIREMENTS:

- Mix factual questions with analytical ones
- Include questions about both individual and team aspects
- Mix questions about players, coaches, fans, and officials
- Vary the complexity of answer choices
- Include questions that require context understanding

SPORT-SPECIFIC FOCUS:

**FINAL CHECK: Ensure every question is about {sport.upper()} and nothing else**
