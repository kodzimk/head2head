   - **Timeout Messages**: Added 5-second timeout message for long waits
   - **State Management**: Better handling of waiting and finished states
   - **Visual Feedback**: Improved waiting state UI with loading indicators

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Waiting Detection**: System detects when one user finishes and waits for the other
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout forces battle completion if one user is waiting too long
- **Delayed Checks**: 10-second delayed completion checks prevent battles from getting stuck
- **Better State Management**: Frontend properly handles waiting states and battle completion

**Benefits**:
- **Reliable Battle Completion**: Battles now properly end when both users finish
- **No Stuck Battles**: Timeout mechanisms prevent battles from getting stuck
- **Better User Experience**: Clear waiting messages and visual feedback

### Development URL Configuration Update (Latest)

## Battle Completion Fix - Missing Battle Object - 2024-12-19

### Task Overview
- **Objective**: Fix battle completion issue where battle object was missing from battles dict
- **Goal**: Ensure battle completion can proceed even when battle object is not available in memory
- **Issue**: Both users finished but battle completion failed due to missing battle object
- **Changes**: Enhanced battle completion logic with fallback data sources

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Battle completion failed with error "Battle not found in battles dict"
- **Root Cause**: Battle object was removed from memory before completion check
- **Impact**: Users finished questions but battle result was not processed
- **Logs**: 
  ```
  [BATTLE_WS] User Hsjsjdd Jsjjsjdjd reached last question, marking as finished
  [BATTLE_WS] User niga reached last question, marking as finished
  [BATTLE_WS] Battle 173ad419-d58d-4ef7-a598-f09b39f5c161 not found in battles dict
  ```

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Battle Info Retrieval (`backend/src/battle_ws.py`)
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Added fallback mechanisms to get battle info from different sources
- **Primary Source**: Try to get battle info from `battles` dict first
- **Fallback Source**: Use `battle_scores` to extract user information if battle object missing
- **Validation**: Ensure both users can be determined before proceeding

#### 2. Improved Completion Detection
- **Robust User Detection**: Enhanced `schedule_next_question` to handle missing battle objects
- **Fallback Logic**: Use `battle_scores` keys to determine user names when battle object unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful handling of missing data
- **Logging**: Enhanced logging to track data source used for user detection

#### 3. Enhanced Battle Result Processing
- **Flexible Data Sources**: `handle_battle_result` can now work with or without battle object
- **Default Values**: Use "Unknown" for sport/level when battle object not available
- **User Extraction**: Extract user information from `battle_scores` as fallback
- **Database Saving**: Ensure battle can be saved to database even without battle object

#### 4. Improved Validation Logic
- **Multiple Validation Sources**: `validate_battle_completion`

## 2024-12-19 - Friend Request Button Logic Fix

### Issue
The button in view-profile page was not changing from "Send Request" to "Cancel Request" after sending a friend request.

### Root Cause
The button logic had redundant conditions and improper flow:
- There was an `else if (!requestSent)` condition that was redundant
- There was a final `else` block with "Cancel Friend Request" that would never be reached
- The logic flow was confusing and not properly structured

### Solution
Simplified the button logic to have clear, non-overlapping conditions:
1. If `areFriends` is true → Show "Battle" button
2. If `hasSentRequestToViewUser || requestSent` is true → Show "Cancel Request" button  
3. Otherwise → Show "Send Request" button

### Files Modified
- `src/modules/profile/view-profile.tsx` - Fixed button logic conditions

### Result
The button now properly changes to "Cancel Request" when a friend request is sent, and the logic is cleaner and more maintainable.
