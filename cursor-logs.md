## Recent Changes

### Reset Statistics System Implementation (Latest)

**Date**: Current Session

**Changes Made**:

1. **Enhanced Reset User Stats Endpoint** (`backend/src/db/router.py`):
   - Added proper ranking recalculation after stats reset
   - After resetting user statistics, the system now calls `update_user_rankings()` to recalculate all user rankings
   - Updated Redis cache with new rankings for the reset user
   - Enhanced websocket notifications to include updated ranking information
   - Added `rankings_recalculated` field to response to indicate success/failure

2. **Enhanced Bulk Reset Endpoint** (`backend/src/db/router.py`):
   - Added ranking recalculation after bulk stats reset for all users
   - Updates Redis cache for all users with new rankings
   - Sends websocket notifications to all users with updated ranking information
   - Added `rankings_recalculated` field to response
3. **Existing Repair Endpoints Already Include Ranking Recalculation**:
   - `repair-user-battles` endpoint already includes `update_user_rankings()` call
   - `force-repair-user-battles` endpoint already includes ranking recalculation
   - These endpoints properly recalculate rankings after repairing user battle data

**Technical Details**:
- Ranking recalculation uses the sophisticated points system from `battle/router.py`
- Points are calculated based on wins, win rate, streaks, experience, and consistency bonuses
- Rankings are updated in both database and Redis cache
